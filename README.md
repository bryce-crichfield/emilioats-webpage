## 1. Create a GitHub Account

If you don't have a GitHub account, you need to create one. Follow these steps:

- Visit [GitHub](https://github.com/) in your web browser.
- Click on the "Sign up" button and follow the on-screen instructions to create your account.

## 2. Create a New Repository

Once you have a GitHub account, you can create a new repository for your project:

- Log in to your GitHub account.
- Click the "+" icon in the top right corner and select "New repository."
- Fill in the repository name, description, and choose other settings.
- Click the "Create repository" button.

## 3. Upload Files to the Repository

After creating a repository, you can add files to it:

- Click the "Add file" button on the repository page.
- Choose either "Upload files" or "Create new file."
- If uploading files, drag and drop your files or choose them manually.
- Provide a commit message and click "Commit changes."

## 4. Create GitHub Pages

GitHub Pages allows you to host your project's documentation or a simple website:

- Navigate to the "Settings" tab in your repository.
- Scroll down to the "GitHub Pages" section.
- Under "Source," select the branch you want to use for GitHub Pages (usually "main").
- Click "Save."
- Your site will be available at `https://username.github.io/repository` (replace `username` with your GitHub username and `repository` with your repository name).

## 5. Custom Domain (Optional)

If you have a custom domain, you can set it up for your GitHub Pages site:

- In the "GitHub Pages" section, click "Add custom domain."
- Follow the instructions to configure your domain settings with your domain registrar.
- It may take some time for the changes to propagate.
